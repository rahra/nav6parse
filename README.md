# nav6parse

This small Perl program converts user data generated by a Seatec NAV6 chart
plotter into the well-known GPX format. It reads the data from standard input
and outputs the GPX data to standard output. Thus just run it as follows:

```Shell
./nav6parse <kpxx99.odf >kpxx99.gpx
```

The resulting file can then be imported into any GPX-aware software (e.g.
Goolge Earth).
